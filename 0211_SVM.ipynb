    "Support vector machines (SVM) are a powerful and flexible class of supervised algorithms. Developed in the 1990s, SVM have shown to perform well in a variety of settings which explains their popularity. Though the underlying mathematics can become somewhat complicated, the basic concept of a SVM is easily understood. Therefore, in what follows we develop an intuition, introduce the mathematical basics of SVM and ultimately look into how we can apply SVM with Python.\n",

All three lie along the (dashed) margin line and in terms of perpendicular distance are equidistant from the decision boundary (solid line). Together they form the so called **support vector**. The support vector \"supports\" the maximal margin hyperplane in the sense that if one of the observations were moved slightly, the maximal margin hyperplane would move as well. In other words, they dictate slope and intercept of  the hyperplane. Interestingly, any points further from the margin that are on the correct side do not modify the decision boundary. For example points at $(x_1, x_2) = (2.5, 1)$ or $(1, 4.2)$ have no effect on the decision boundary. Technically, this is because these points do not contribute to the loss function used to fit the model, so their position and number do not matter so long as they do not cross the margin (VanderPlas (2016)) . This is an important and helpful property as it simplifies calculations significantly. It is not surprising that computations are a lot faster if a model has only a few data points (in the support vector) to consider (James et al. (2013)). "

    "Given our data is separable into two classes, the maximal margin classifier from before seems like a natural approach. However, it is easy to see that **when the data is not clearly discriminable, no separable hyperplane exists and therefore such a classifier does not exist**. In that case the above maximization problem has no solution. What makes the situation even more complicated is that the maximal margin classifier is very sensitive to changes in the support vectors. This means that this classifier might suffer from inappropriate sensitivity to individual observations and thus it has a substantial risk of overfitting the training data. That is why we might be willing to consider a classifier on a hyperplane that does not perfectly separate the two classes but allows for greater robustness to individual observations and better classification of most of the training observations. In other words it could be worthwhile to misclassify a few training observations in order to do a better job in classifying the test data (James et al. (2013)). "

    "### The Problem with Mapping Functions\n",
    "One could think that this is the recipe to work with nonlinear data: Transform all training data onto a higher-dimensional feature space via some mapping function $\\phi$ train a linear SVM model and use the same function $\\phi$ to transform new (test) data to classify it. \n",
    "\n",
    "As attractive as this idea seems, it is unfortunately unfeasible because it quickly becomes computationally too expensive. Here is a hands-on example why: Consider for example a degree-2 polynomial (kernel) transformation of the form $\\phi(x_1, x_2) = (x_1^2, x_2^2, \\sqrt{2} x_1 x_2, \\sqrt{2c} x_1, \\sqrt{2c} x_2, c)$. This means that for a dataset in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ the transformation adds four additional dimensions ($\\mathbb{R}^2 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^6$). If we generalize this, it means that a $d$-dimensional polynomial (Kernel) transformation maps from $\\mathbb{R}^p$ to an ${p + d}\\choose{d}$-dimensional space [(Balcan (2011))](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/%7Eninamf/ML11/lect1020.pdf). Thus for datasets with $p$ large, naively performing such transformations will force most computers to its knees. "

    "### The Kernel Trick\n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully, not all is lost. It turns out that one does not need to explicitly work in the higher-dimensional space. One can show that when using Lagrange to solve our optimization problem, the training samples are only used to compute the pair-wise dot products $\\langle x_i, x_{j}\\rangle$ (where $x_i, x_{j} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p}$). This is significant because there exist functions that, given two vectors $x_i$ and $x_{j}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^p$, implicitly compute the dot product between the two vectors in a higher-dimension $\\mathbb{R}^q$ (with $q > p$) without explicitly transforming $x_i, x_{j}$ onto a higher dimension $\\mathbb{R}^q$. Such functions are called **Kernel** functions, written $K(x_i, x_{j})$ [(Kim (2013))](http://www.eric-kim.net/eric-kim-net/posts/1/kernel_trick_blog_ekim_12_20_2017.pdf). \n",

For ease of reading we use $x = (x_1, x_2)$ and $z=(z_1, z_2)$ instead of $x_i$ and $x_{j}$. Consider the Kernel function $K(x, z) = (x^T z)^2$ and the mapping function $\\phi(x) = (x_1^2, \\sqrt{2}x_1 x_2, x_2^2)$. If we were to solve our optimization problem from above with Lagrange, the mapping function appears in the form $\\phi(x)^T \\phi(z)$."

This is of course only one (toy) example and far away from a proper proof but it provides the intuition of what can be generalized: that by using a Kernel function, e.g. where $K(x_i, x_j) = (x^T z)^2 = \\phi(x_i)^T \\phi(x_j)$, we implicitly transform our data to a higher-dimension without having to explicitly apply a mapping function $\\phi$.

    "\n",
    "Having build an intuition of how SVM work, let us now see this algorithm applied in Python. We will again use the Scikit-learn package that has an optimized class implemented. The data we will work with is called \"Polish Companies Bankruptcy Data Set\" and was used in Zieba et al. (2014). The full set comprises five data files. Each file contains 64 features plus a class label. The features are ratios derived from the financial statements of the more than 10'000 manufacturing companies considered during the period of 2000 - 2013 (from EBITDA margin to equity ratio to liquidity ratios (quick ratio) etc.. The five files differ in that the first contains data with companies that defaulted/were still running **five** years down the road ('1year.csv'), the second **four** years down the road ('2year.csv') etc. Details can be found in the original publication (Zikeba et al. (2016)) or in the [description provided on the UCI Machine Learning Repository site](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Polish+companies+bankruptcy+data) where the data was downloaded from. For our purposes we will use the '5year.csv' file where we should predict defaults within the next year. "

    "## Dealing with Class Imbalance\n",
    "\n",
    "When we deal with default data sets we observe that the ratio of non-default to default records is heavily skewed towards non-default. This is a common problem in real-world data set: Samples from one class or multiple classes dominate the data set. For the present data set we are talking 93% non-defaults vs. 7% defaults. Having an algorithm that predicts non-default 100 out of a 100 times is right in 93% of the cases. Therefore, training a model on such a data set that achieves the same 93% test accuracy (as our SVM above) means nothing else than our model hasn't learned anything informative from the features provided in this data set. Thus, when assessing a classifier on an imbalanced data set we have learned that other metrics such as precision, recall, ROC curve etc. might be more informative. \n",
    "\n",
    "Having said that, what we have to consider is that a class imbalance might influences a learning algorithm during the model fitting itself. Machine learning algorithms typically optimize a reward or cost function. This means that an algorithm implicitly learns the model that optimizes the predictions based on the most abundant class in the dataset in order to minimize the cost or maximize the reward during the training phase. And this in turn might yield skewed results in case of imbalanced data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several options to deal with class imbalance, we will discuss two of them. The first option is to set the `class_weight` parameter to `class_weight='balanced'`. Most classifier hae this option implemented (of the introduced classifiers, KNN, LDA and QDA lack such a parameter). This will assign a larger penalty to wrong predictions on the minority class."

    "Another tool that is of help in optimizing our model is the `GridSearchCV` function introduced in the previous chapter that finds the best hyperparameter through a brute-force (cross validation) approach. Yet before we simply copy-past the code from the last chapter we ought to address a subtle yet important difference between the decision tree and SVM (or most other ML) algorithms that has implications on the application: Decision tree algorithms are of the few models where data scaling is not necessary. SVM on the other hand are (as most ML algorithms) fairly sensitive to the magnitude of the data. Now you might say that this is precisely why we standardized the data at the very beginning and with that we are good to go. In principle, this is correct. However, if we are precise, we commit a subtle yet possibly significant thought error. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we decide to apply a grid search using cross validation to find the optimal hyperparameter for e.g. a SVM we unfortunately can not just scale the full data set at the very beginning and then be good for the rest of the process. Conceptually it is important to understand why. Assume we have a data set. As we learned in the chapter on feature scaling and cross validation, applying a scaling on the combined data set and splitting the set into training and holdout set after the scaling is wrong. The reason is that information from the test set found its way into the model and distorts the results. The training set is scaled  not only based on information from that set but also based on information from the test set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now the same is true if we apply a gridsearch process with cross validation on a training set. For each fold in the CV, some part of the training set will be declared as the training part, and some the test part. The test part within this split is used to measure the performance of our model trained on the training part. However, if we simply scale the training set and then apply gridsearch-CV on the scaled training set we would commit the same thought error as if we simply scale the full set at the very beginning. The test fold (of the CV split) would no longer be independent but implicitly already be part of the training set we used to fit the model. This is fundamentally different from how new data looks to the model. The test data within each cross validation split would no longer correctly mirrors how new data would look to the modeling process. Information already leaked from the test data into our modeling process. This would lead to overly optimistic results during cross validation, and possibly the selection of suboptimal parameter (Müller & Guido (2017)).\n",
    "\n",
    "We have not addressed this problem in the chapter on cross validation because so far we have not introduced the tool to deal with it. Furthermore, if our data set is homogeneous and of some size, this is less of an issue. Yet as Scikit-learn provides a fantastic tool to deal with this (and many other) issue(s), we want to introduce it here. The tool is called **pipelines** and allows to combine multiple processing steps in a very convenient and proper way. Let us look at how we can use the `Pipeline` class to express the end-to-end workflow. First we build a pipeline object. This object is provided a list of steps. Each step is a tuple containing a name (you define) and an instance of an estimator. "

We will discuss feature selection and dimension reduction options in the next section but for the moment, let us just apply a method called Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA effectively transforms the feature space from $\\mathbb{R}^{p} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{q}$ with $q$ being a user specified value (but usually $q < < p$). PCA is similar to other preprocessing steps and can be included in pipelines as e.g. `StandardScaler`. \n",

However, this comes at a cost: by reducing the feature space we might not only get rid of noise but also lose part of the information available in the full dataset. Our model accuracy might suffer as a consequence. Furthermore, the speed that we gain by fitting a model to a smaller subset can be set off by the additional computations it takes to calculate the PCA. In the example of the upsampled data set we would be talking of an $[11'000 \\cdot 0.8 \\cdot 0.8 \\times 63]$ matrix (0.8 for the train/test-split and each cv fold) for which eigenvector and eigenvalues need to be calculated.

    "### Principal Component Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section you learned an approach for reducing the dimensionality of a data set through feature selection. An alternative to feature selection is feature extraction, of which Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is the best known and most popular approach. It is an unsupervised method that aims to summarize the information content of a data set by transforming it onto a new feature subspace of lower dimensionality than the original one. With the rise of big data, this is a field that is gaining importance by the day. PCA is widely used in a variety of field - e.g. in finance to de-noise signals in stock market trading, create factor models, for feature selection in bankruptcy prediction, dimensionality reduction of high frequency data etc.. Unfortunately, the scope of this course does not allow us to discuss PCA in great detail. Nevertheless the fundamentals shall be addressed here briefly so that the reader has a good understanding of how PCA helps in reducing dimensionality. \n",
    "\n",
    "To build an intuition for PCA we quote the excellent James et al. (2013, p. 375): *\"PCA finds a low-dimensional representation of a dataset that contains as much as possible of the **variation**. The idea is that each of the $n$ observations lives in $p$-dimensional space, but not all of these dimensions are equally interesting. PCA seeks a small number of dimensions that are as interesting as possible, where the concept of interesting is measured by the amount that the observation vary along each dimension. Each of the dimensions found by PCA is a linear combination of the $p$ features.\"* Since each principal component is required to be orthogonal to all other principal components, we basically take correlated original variables (features) and replace them with a small set of principal components that capture their joint variation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below figures aim at visualizing the idea of principal components. In both figures we see the same two-dimensional dataset. PCA searches for the principal axis along which the data varies most. These principal axis measure the variance of the data when projected onto that axis. The two vectors (arrows) in the left plot visualize this. Notice that given an $[n \\times p]$ feature matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ there are at most $\\min(n-1, p)$ principal components. The figure on the right-hand side displays the projection of the data points projected onto the first principal axis. In this way we have reduced the dimensionality from $\\mathbf{R}^2$ to $\\mathbf{R}^1$. In practice, PCA is of course primarily used for datasets with $p$ large and the selected number of principal components $q$ is usually much smaller than the dimension of the original dataset ($q << p)$."
